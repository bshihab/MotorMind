# MotorMind: EEG-LLM Architecture

This document outlines the innovative approach of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to decode and interpret EEG motor imagery data, which is the core technical innovation of the MotorMind project.

## Overview

Traditional approaches to EEG motor imagery classification typically involve:
1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
3. Capsule Networks

MotorMind takes a novel approach by leveraging Large Language Models to analyze EEG data, with several key advantages:
- **Few-shot learning capabilities**: Requiring less training data
- **Transparent reasoning**: Providing interpretable analysis with intermediate steps
- **Adaptability**: Generalizing across different users and EEG hardware
- **Multi-scale analysis**: Analyzing patterns at different temporal scales

## Data Flow Architecture

```
[EEG Headset] → [Preprocessing] → [Feature Extraction] → [Text Encoding] → [LLM] → [Interpretation] → [Application]
```

### 1. EEG Signal Acquisition

- Support for multiple EEG devices (consumer and research-grade)
- Focus on motor imagery regions (sensorimotor cortex)
- Acquisition of raw EEG data

### 2. Preprocessing Pipeline

- **Filtering**: Band-pass filtering to isolate relevant frequencies (mu and beta rhythms)
- **Artifact Removal**: ICA-based or other methods to remove eye blinks, muscle artifacts
- **Epoching**: Division into meaningful time segments 
- **Normalization**: Standardizing signal amplitudes

### 3. Feature Extraction

Based on the EEG-GPT paper, we extract the following features:
- **Line Length Features**: Efficient feature for detecting signal changes
- **Power Spectral Features**: FFT-based features in relevant frequency bands
- **Connectivity Measures**: Phase synchronization between channels
- **Statistical Features**: Variance, skewness, kurtosis, etc.

Features are calculated per channel and per frequency band of interest.

### 4. Feature-to-Text Conversion

This is a key innovation - converting numerical EEG features into a textual format that LLMs can process:

```
Example Format:
"Channel C3, Alpha Band (8-12 Hz): Power = 0.75 μV², Variance = 0.12, Line Length = 0.45, 
Channel C4, Alpha Band (8-12 Hz): Power = 0.82 μV², Variance = 0.09, Line Length = 0.38,
Connectivity C3-C4, Alpha Band: Phase Synchronization = 0.65"
```

Additional context can be provided:
- User-specific information
- Task being performed
- Historical patterns

### 5. LLM Integration

The project will use two approaches:

#### a. Few-shot Learning Approach

Using the methodology described in the EEG-GPT paper:
1. Train the LLM with a small set of labeled examples
2. Provide in-context examples for classification
3. Utilize prompting techniques to guide the model

#### b. Fine-tuning Approach

1. Start with a pre-trained LLM (GPT, LLaMA, etc.)
2. Fine-tune on a dataset of EEG features with corresponding labels
3. Optimize for both classification accuracy and reasoning transparency

### 6. Tree-of-Thought Reasoning

Implementing the "Tree of Thought" approach from the paper to:
1. Break down EEG analysis into logical steps
2. Consider multiple interpretations of the data
3. Trace through possible patterns
4. Arrive at the most likely interpretation with confidence scores

Example reasoning flow:
```
Step 1: Analyze power in motor cortex regions
Step 2: Check for event-related desynchronization in mu rhythm
Step 3: Compare contralateral and ipsilateral activity
Step 4: Identify temporal pattern matching motor imagery
Step 5: Classify as "right hand movement imagery" with 87% confidence
```

### 7. Supabase Integration

Supabase will be used to:

1. **Store Raw and Processed Data**:
   - Using TimescaleDB extension for time-series EEG data
   - Storing extracted features for reuse

2. **Track Model Performance**:
   - Recording predictions and ground truth
   - Storing user feedback for continual improvement

3. **Enable Collaboration**:
   - Sharing datasets between researchers
   - Comparing model performance across different approaches

4. **Real-time Monitoring**:
   - Using Supabase's realtime features for live EEG monitoring
   - Providing immediate feedback during training sessions

## Technical Innovations

### 1. Multi-modal Representation Learning

- Converting numerical EEG data to text representations
- Preserving spatial and temporal relationships
- Enabling LLMs to process non-text modalities

### 2. Hybrid Knowledge Approach

- Combining domain-specific EEG knowledge with LLM's general knowledge
- Using medical terminology and descriptions in prompts
- Creating a knowledge bridge between neuroscience and AI

### 3. Explainable BCI

- Using the LLM's natural language generation to explain classifications
- Tracing the reasoning process for clinicians and researchers
- Building trust through transparency

### 4. Transfer Learning Across Users

- Using few-shot learning to quickly adapt to new users
- Identifying common patterns across different individuals
- Reducing the need for extensive calibration sessions
